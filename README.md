# GrandSlamTennis

###Project Two

GrandSlamTennis is General Assembly's WDI-ATL cohort 5's second project. GrandSlamTennis is a full-stack application that was developed using Ruby on Rails.  The technical requirements of the assignment included:

* creating at least 2 models - one for a user and the other for the main functional idea of the app
* implementing sign up/sign in components
* using RESTful routes
* generating a database table structure with an ORM 



###GrandSlamTennis Basics

GrandSlamTennis has two functions.  The first is for the general user who, after signing up/in, can get general information about players competing in Grand Slam events.  The second is for an admin user who can update player, country and user data.  The general user does not have access to the admin user pages.
